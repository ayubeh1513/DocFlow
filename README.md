## Introduction

The Document Flow Manager is designed to replace traditional, manual approval chains with a transparent, efficient, and digital alternative. It provides a clear, multi-level review process for text-based submissions within an organization. The system is built around three distinct user roles—**Submitter**, **Reviewer**, and **Head of Department (HOD)**—each with a tailored dashboard and specific permissions to ensure a secure and focused user experience.

## Key Features

* ✅ **Role-Based Dashboards:** Unique interfaces for Submitters, Reviewers, and the HOD, showing only relevant information and actions.
* ✅ **Text-Based Workflow:** The entire approval process is managed through structured text details, eliminating the complexity of file management.
* ✅ **Real-Time Status Tracking:** Leveraging Supabase's real-time capabilities, status updates (`Under Review`, `Forwarded to HOD`, `Approved`, `Needs Revision`) are instantly reflected across all dashboards.
* ✅ **Secure, Pre-Registered Access:** A secure, invitation-only model where all user accounts are pre-registered, enhancing security by removing public sign-up.
* ✅ **Clean & Modern UI:** Built with Flutter, featuring a professional and intuitive user interface with a teal and indigo color palette for excellent readability.

## Workflow

The application follows a clear, three-step approval process:

1.  **Initiation:** A **Submitter** creates a new request with project details and assigns it to a specific **Reviewer**.
2.  **Initial Review:** The assigned **Reviewer** examines the details and decides to either **Reject** it or **Forward** it to the HOD for final approval.
3.  **Final Decision:** The **HOD** reviews the forwarded request and makes the final decision to **Approve** or **Reject**. The final status is then visible to the Submitter.

## Technology Stack

* **Frontend:** Flutter
* **Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS):** Supabase
    * **Database:** Supabase PostgreSQL
    * **Authentication:** Supabase Auth
    * **Realtime:** Supabase Realtime Subscriptions

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

* [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) (version 3.0.0 or higher)
* A code editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
* A free [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) account

### Supabase Setup

1.  **Create a New Project:**
    * Go to your Supabase dashboard and create a new project.

2.  **Run the SQL Script:**
    * Navigate to the **SQL Editor** in your new project.
    * Copy the entire content of the [database setup script](./supabase_setup.sql) and run it. This will create the necessary tables and policies.
    * *(Note: You will need to create a `supabase_setup.sql` file in your project root and paste the SQL script from our conversation into it).*

3.  **Create Users:**
    * Go to the **Authentication** tab in your Supabase project.
    * Manually create the 7 users as specified in the "Test User Credentials" section below. Use the password `123456` for all of them.
    * After creating the users, go back to the **SQL Editor** and run the `INSERT` statements from the setup script to populate the `profiles` table, making sure to use the correct `UUID` for each user.

4.  **Get API Credentials:**
    * Navigate to **Project Settings** > **API**.
    * You will need the **Project URL** and the `anon` **public** key for the next step.

### Flutter Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/document-flow-manager.git](https://github.com/your-username/document-flow-manager.git)
    cd document-flow-manager
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

3.  **Add Supabase Credentials:**
    * Open the `lib/main.dart` file.
    * Find the following lines and replace the placeholder values with your actual Supabase URL and Anon Key:
        ```dart
        // --- SUPABASE CONFIGURATION ---
        const String supabaseUrl = 'YOUR_SUPABASE_URL';
        const String supabaseAnonKey = 'YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY';
        ```

4.  **Run the Application:**
    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```
